# ðŸ“Š Machine Learning-Driven Portfolio Optimization using Clustering and Ensemble Learning

This project presents a robust framework for **portfolio optimization** using **machine learning models** enhanced with **clustering techniques** and **Markowitz-based risk weighting**. The work focuses on stock selection within the **S&P 500 index**, applying various financial indicators and historical patterns to predict returns and build optimized, dynamically rebalanced portfolios.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

### Objectives:
- Predict future stock returns using ensemble machine learning models.
- Improve asset selection and diversification using clustering (KMeans, Birch).
- Integrate Markowitz risk-aware weighting for robust portfolio construction.
- Evaluate risk-adjusted metrics like Sharpe, Sortino, Max Drawdown, VaR/CVaR.

## ðŸ§  Methodology

### ðŸ“¥ Data Collection & Preprocessing
- Historical OHLCV data and technical indicators (RSI, MACD, SMA, EMA, etc.)
- Integrated fundamental features: P/E Ratio, ROE, Market Cap
- Feature scaling via `StandardScaler`
- Missing values filled using median (excluding key financials)

### ðŸ§© Clustering
- **KMeans & Birch Clustering** to group stocks by behavior
- Cluster ratings assigned based on average **Sharpe Ratio** and **Drawdown**
- Added as categorical features to ML models

### ðŸ§® Markowitz Weighting
- Monthly inverse-variance weighting to signal low-risk, high-return assets
- Weights merged as features

### ðŸ¤– Machine Learning Models
- **Neural Network (Keras)**: Deep MLP with dropout & batch normalization
- **XGBoost Regressor**
- **LightGBM Regressor**
- Target variable: M-day Future Return

### ðŸ§ª Ensemble Modeling
- Simple average ensemble of 3 models
- Prevents overfitting and improves generalization

### ðŸ“ˆ Portfolio Simulation
- Top N predicted return stocks selected at each rebalance (M-day interval)
- Weighted using softmax of predicted return
- Performance tracked daily with risk metrics
